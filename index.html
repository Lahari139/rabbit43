        <font face="roboto"><u><i> International Rabbits Day</u></i></font>
    </h3>
    <i>
        <p>International Rabbit Day is celebrated on the fourth Saturday of September every year, falling on September
            24 this year. Although we would love to celebrate bunnies every day, this day is especially observed to
            promote the care and protection of domestic and wild rabbits. The Rabbit Charity in the U.K. founded
            International Rabbit Day in 1998. The goal of this initiative is to ensure that rabbits that have been left
            unprotected or abandoned, find care and permanent shelters. Rabbits are prone to viral diseases and can
            become easy prey for a lot of animals. This day reminds us that there is more we can do for them.</p>

    </h4>
    <p><i>Rabbits belong to the Leporidae family and their fossil records date back to 40 million years ago. Out of the
            28 different species, the European rabbit is the most well-known. The species was initially found in the
            Iberian Peninsula and northwestern Africa and then showed up in western Europe about 2,000 years ago. During
            the early 1950s, a viral disease called myxomatosis proved to be lethal to European rabbits and the initial
            wave wiped out 99% of the population in Australia. The remaining rabbits were able to develop immunity by
            the time the subsequent waves came. In recent years, the rabbit population has been declining and this has
            resulted in a larger impact on our natural ecosystems as rabbits are a vital prey for other animals. In
            1996, the International Union for Conservation of Nature, or IUCN, declared the Sumatran rabbit found in
            Southeast Asia to be a critically endangered species. There have been only two sightings of the species in
            the 21st century. The IUCN also placed the European rabbit species in the “Near Threatened” category in
            2019, with a possibility of extinction. There have been programs and initiatives taken up by charities and
            welfare bodies to protect rabbits. The Riverine Rabbit Programme is one such effort that was established in
            2003, and they aimed to coordinate and oversee the conservation efforts towards the critically endangered
            Riverine rabbit, along with its habitat. In India, The Leporidae family (rabbits and hare) receive
            protection under the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 because two of the existing species are endangered.
            International Rabbit Day was founded in 1998 by The Rabbit Charity in the U.K., and it became a significant
            day to celebrate and spread awareness about rabbit protection and conservation...</i></p>
